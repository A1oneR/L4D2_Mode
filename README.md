# L4D2 Mode
The plugins last 3 years and there is no backup online for now, that why I create this repository. 

The main part is from the ZoneMod, and the last part is my talent(or silly IDK XD) show.

You can see what cfg inside the folder and make your own special things.

But the plugins you need will not be shown to the public, you can check the Zonemod for the base and various way to find the remaining part of the plugins.

So you need some basic knowledge about how to use plugins and mix them together without errors.

Don't worry, the cfgs contains the plugin's name you may need, it may be helpful for you to find the plugins you want.

Also, the author(Me) is not a native English speaker. It will be difficult to introduce what I really want to show. So you know, I can't help you much about the server's problem. You may need to ask someone who knows it and have great ability of speaking.

And the README next part is to introduce the Mode I have made.

## DRDK
Vanilla versus with some confogl and magic configs.

The survivor team will get 4 Medkits and 4 Pills when they left saferoom.

The damage of the infected team has been increased, and the T2 weapon of survivors have different changes.

The Stripper mixes the SKY stripper and the Zonemod stripper with some of my personal change.

## Tryning 1vN
The survivor is alone, but the infected are much more dangerous than before. At least, there is only one person in survivor team.

It is a training mode, help you to be against the infected attack. You will not be knocked down with just a simple pounced or punch, but it will reduce the HP that you had.

You may easily enter the saferoom with full HP, or you can die just in half way with Totally 7 infected real players.
